# MVVM_Alamofire_TableView


We'll see MVVM Design Pattern where we'll be using UITableView & Alamofire To complete the task. 

This task require basic understandings with GitHub REST API. 

A search bar that enables us to fetch GitHub user profiles by username:
If no user exists with the username provided, present a "Not found" view
If the user exists, present a view with that user's:
Avatar
Username
Name
Description
Follower count, i.e. X followers
Following count, i.e. X following
A view which displays a list of the user's followers, as well as a view for who they're following
We should be able to navigate to this view by tapping on the follower/following counts
If a user in this list is tapped, it should navigate us to their profile view
The ability to navigate backwards through the navigation stack
